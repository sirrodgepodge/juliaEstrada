        | #[i.fa.fa-quote-left] Julia Estrada as Maria was outstanding. Her clear, sweet soprano voice was equal to the demands of the score. I predict a bright future for her.&quot;

        | #[i.fa.fa-quote-left] Maria, played by Julia Estrada, has a sweet, angelic soprano with a youthful touch. Estrada plays Maria as a young girl, obsessed and in awe of her good fortune in finding Tony. Estrada is lovely and ethereal as Maria.&quot;
