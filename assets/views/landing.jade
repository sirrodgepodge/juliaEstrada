          p As a patron, great coffee was few and far between when I moved west in 2013 from the Washington DC area. &nbsp;There were some solid shops here in the Reno-Tahoe area, but they were kinda pricy. &nbsp;Nobody blew my mind with the cups they were giving, but their prices sure did! #[br]#[br] My friend convinced me to roast beans for myself at a quarter of the price of the local coffee chains, but with unrivaled flavor. &nbsp;So I give to you my passion and meticulously microroasted coffee. &nbsp;Roasting less than a pound at a time allows a handcrafted experience that you won't find anywhere else. &nbsp;Thanks, again, for being a part of this and joining me in this beautiful world of coffee!

          p You might not know that coffee actually comes from the inside of coffee cherries, like the ones in this picture. #[br]#[br] The coffee connoisseurs of Cafe Jefe sure do though! &nbsp;Their travels will take them to tropical climates to find the best coffees on the planet. &nbsp;It's not enough to stop there though, we also ensure that the farmers growing our lovely beans are getting fair pay for their work and product.
